        <p>Oak Park is a great place to grow up. It has wonderful public schools, parks, and public transportation. It is located just west of the Chicago city limits and is accessible by both the blue and green El lines.</p>
        <p>I lived in Oak Park from when I was born until right before I started High School. My dad owned a bakery. I was on the club swim team, and swam in statewide events.</p>

        <p>After Oak Park, my family moved to Saint Louis. I have moved away quite a few times but for some reason I keep coming back.</p>
        <p>I went to High School here, but graduated early and started attending WUSTL. Then I left to go to college out of state and eventually came back. Now I live in a beautiful neighborhood in south Saint Louis City.</p>

        <p>This town is so tiny it doesn't even have a website!</p>
        <p>Bard College is the main feature of the town, and supports some of the small neighboring communities. I attended college here to study creative writing.</p>
